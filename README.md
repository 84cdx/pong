# pong

This is a simple Pong game written in Python using the Turtle library. The game features a minimalist design with sound effects and player vs. player mode. It was developed as a Python programming exercise.

## Features
- Minimalist design
- Player vs. Player mode
- Sound effects on ball bounce
- Scoring system

## How to Play
- Player A uses the keys 'W' (up) and 'S' (down) to move their paddle.
- Player B uses the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys to move their paddle.
- The game starts when the 'Enter' key is pressed.
- The ball will bounce off the walls and paddles. If it goes beyond a paddle, the score resets.
